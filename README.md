Turn APIs, databases, and scripts into MCP tools — without writing MCP servers. Airtruct is an open-source, self-hosted platform that lets you visually build tools for AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and AI agents. Connect 66+ sources, define parameters, and get an instant MCP endpoint. Single binary, no Docker or JVM required.

**[Documentation](https://airtruct.com/)** | **[Playbooks](https://airtruct.com/playbooks)**

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
curl -Lsf https://airtruct.com/sh/install | bash
```

See the [Installation docs](https://airtruct.com/docs/getting-started/installation) for more options.

### Run

```bash
# Start coordinator
airtruct -role coordinator -grpc-port 50000

# Start worker (in a separate terminal)
airtruct -role worker -grpc-port 50001
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** and start building MCP tools.

### Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sananguliyev/airtruct
```

See the [Installation docs](https://airtruct.com/docs/getting-started/installation) for Docker run commands and the [Configuration docs](https://airtruct.com/docs/getting-started/configuration) for database setup.

## How It Works

1. **Connect** — Pick from 66+ built-in connectors for APIs, databases, queues, and services.
2. **Define Tool** — Set the tool name, description, and input parameters. Airtruct generates the MCP tool automatically.
3. **Use With AI** — Tools are instantly callable by Claude, Cursor, AI agents, and internal copilots via the `/mcp` endpoint.

## Features

- **Instant MCP Endpoint** — Flows are auto-registered as MCP tools, discoverable by any MCP client
- **Visual Tool Builder** — Drag-and-drop DAG editor to build and manage tools and data flows
- **66+ Connectors** — Kafka, HTTP, AMQP, MySQL CDC, PostgreSQL, and more
- **Built-in Transformations** — Transform data with Bloblang DSL and JSON Schema validation
- **Parameter Validation** — Define types, descriptions, and required flags visible to AI assistants
- **Secure Credentials** — Encrypted secrets management for API keys and tokens
- **Automation Flows** — Move and route data between systems, or orchestrate AI workflows that call your MCP tools
- **Horizontal Scaling** — Coordinator & worker architecture for easy scaling
- **Single Binary** — No Docker, JVM, or external dependencies required
- **Self-hosted & Open Source** — Full control over your data, Apache 2.0 licensed
