Airtruct is a modern, open-source data pipeline tool designed to be a powerful and efficient alternative to tools like Airbyte and Fivetran. It empowers data analysts and scientists to easily build and manage data streams with a user-friendly, DAG-style UI.

## Key Features

* **Visual DAG-style Stream Builder:** Intuitive UI to visually create and manage data pipelines using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) interface.
* **Powerful In-Pipeline Transformations:** Utilize Bloblang, a lightweight, JSON-like DSL, for efficient data transformation and enrichment within the pipeline. Bloblang offers built-in mapping, filtering, and conditional logic, often replacing the need for separate transformation tools like dbt.
* **Flexible Subprocess Processor:** Integrate processors or enrichers developed in any programming language. Communication occurs via stdin/stdout, ensuring language-agnostic compatibility.
* **Native HTTP Input:** Accept data over HTTP, making it ideal for handling webhooks and streaming data sources. 
* **Horizontally Scalable Worker Pool Architecture:** Scale your data processing capabilities with a horizontally scalable worker pool. 
* **Delivery Guarantee:** Ensures reliable data delivery. 
* **Buffering and Caching:** Optimizes performance through buffering and caching mechanisms.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Provides comprehensive error handling capabilities.

---

Airtruct provides a modern, lightweight, and open alternative to traditional ETL platforms.  
Unlike container-heavy or closed systems, Airtruct focuses on flexibility, performance, and developer freedom ‚Äî allowing users to build powerful pipelines with minimal operational overhead.

Whether you need real-time webhook ingestion, easy custom processors in any language, or fine-grained observability ‚Äî Airtruct is built to scale with you.

## Architecture

Airtruct employs a Coordinator & Worker model: 

* **Coordinator:** Handles pipeline orchestration and workload balancing across workers.
* **Workers:** Stateless processing units that auto-scale to meet processing demands.

This architecture is lightweight and modular, with no Docker dependency, enabling easy deployment on various platforms, including Kubernetes, bare-metal servers, and virtual machines.

## Performance & Scalability

Airtruct is designed for high performance and scalability:

* **Go-native:** Built as a single binary with no VM or container overhead, keeping things light and fast. 
* **Memory-safe and Low CPU Usage:** Engineered for efficient resource utilization. 
* **Smart Load Balancing:** Worker pool model with intelligent load balancing. 
* **Parallel Execution Control:** Fine-grained control over parallel processing threads. 
* **Real-time & Batch Friendly:** Supports both real-time and batch data processing.
